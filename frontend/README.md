## üìä API Integration

The frontend integrates with all 17 backend API endpoints:

- `GET /api/employees` - Get all employees (paginated)
- `GET /api/employees/{id}` - Get employee by ID
- `PUT /api/employees/{id}` - Update employee
- `DELETE /api/employees/{id}` - Delete employee

### Search & Filter
- `GET /api/employees/search` - Search employees
- `GET /api/employees/department/{dept}` - Filter by department
- `GET /api/employees/position/{position}` - Filter by position
- `GET /api/employees/status/{status}` - Filter by status

### Advanced Filters

```javascript
this.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8081/api/employees';
```

### UI Preferences
The application automatically saves user preferences:
- Theme selection
- Page size
- Default sorting
- Form preferences

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Connection Errors
- **Issue**: "Network error or server unavailable"
- **Solution**: Ensure Spring Boot backend is running on port 8081
- **Check**: Open `http://localhost:8081/api/employees` in browser

#### CORS Errors
- **Issue**: Cross-origin requests blocked
- **Solution**: Ensure your Spring Boot backend has CORS enabled
- **Note**: The backend should include `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` annotation

#### Charts Not Loading
- **Issue**: Charts appear as empty boxes
- **Solution**: Ensure Chart.js CDN is accessible
- **Check**: Internet connection and CDN availability

#### Form Validation Errors
- **Issue**: Form won't submit despite filled fields
- **Solution**: Check browser console for validation errors
- **Note**: All fields marked with * are required

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support  
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
- **IE**: Not supported (use modern browser)

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. **Use pagination** for large datasets (default: 10 items per page)
2. **Enable caching** - API responses are cached for 1 minute
3. **Use filters** instead of loading all employees at once
4. **Clear search** when not needed to improve performance

## üîí Security Notes

- All API requests include proper headers
- Form validation prevents malicious input
- No sensitive data is stored in localStorage
- CORS configuration should be properly set on backend

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- **PWA Support**: Offline functionality with service workers
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization (i18n)
- **Advanced Charts**: More detailed analytics and visualizations
- **Print Support**: Formatted printing of employee reports
- **Email Integration**: Direct email communication
- **Photo Upload**: Employee profile pictures

## ü§ù Contributing

To extend or modify the application:

1. **Adding new features**: Create new methods in appropriate classes
2. **Styling changes**: Modify CSS variables in `:root` for consistent theming
3. **New API endpoints**: Add methods to `api.js` and corresponding UI in `ui.js`
4. **New charts**: Extend `charts.js` with additional visualization methods
